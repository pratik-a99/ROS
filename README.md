## ROS based Obstacle Recognition & Avoidance Drone (June 2020 - July 2020)

A hobby-project to garner experience in ROS development environment, Gazebo and Autonomous Drone programming. The project utilized YOLO, a real-time object detection system by Darknet, and Artificial Potential Field to achieve obstacle avoidance using LIDAR in a simulation environment. ROS nodes(programs) were written in C++ with the help of iq gnc API. Turtlebot3 was also simulated in Gazebo to understand ROS navigation.
